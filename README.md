API Usage
The app relies on NewsAPI (or a similar API) to fetch news articles. Here are the primary API requests used:

Fetching Top Headlines:

javascript

https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
Fetching News by Category:

javascript

https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?category=technology&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
Searching for News Articles:

javascript

https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=keyword&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
JavaScript Example (Fetching News)
In the script.js file, you can use fetch to make API requests and render the news:

javascript
Copy code
const API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
const url = `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=${API_KEY}`;

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Handle data and render articles to the page
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching the news:', error);
  });
